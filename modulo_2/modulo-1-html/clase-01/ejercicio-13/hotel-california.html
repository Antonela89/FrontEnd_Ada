    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair</p>
    <p>Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air</p>
    <p>Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light</p>
    <p>My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim</p>
    <p>I had to stop for the night</p>
    <br>
    <p>There she stood in the doorway;</p>
    <p>I heard the mission bell</p>
    <p>And I was thinking to myself</p>
    <p>'This could be heaven or this could be Hell'</p>
    <p>Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way</p>
    <p>There were voices down the corridor,</p>
    <p>I thought I heard them say</p>
    <br>
    <p>Welcome to the Hotel California</p>
    <p>Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)</p>
    <p>Such a lovely face</p>
    <p>Plenty of room at the Hotel California</p>
    <p>Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here</p>
    <br>
    <p>Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends</p>
    <p>She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends</p>
    <p>How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat</p>
    <p>Some dance to remember, some dance to forget</p>
    <br>
    <p>So I called up the Captain,</p>
    <p>'Please bring me my wine'</p>
    <p>He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine'</p>
    <p>And still those voices are calling from far away,</p>
    <p>Wake you up in the middle of the night</p>
    <p>Just to hear them say</p>
    <br>
    <p>Welcome to the Hotel California</p>
    <p>Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)</p>
    <p>Such a lovely face</p>
    <p>They livin' it up at the Hotel California</p>
    <p>What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis</p>
    <br>
    <p>Mirrors on the ceiling,</p>
    <p>The pink champagne on ice</p>
    <p>And she said, 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device'</p>
    <p>And in the master's chambers,</p>
    <p>They gathered for the feast</p>
    <p>They stab it with their steely knives,</p>
    <p>But they just can't kill the beast</p>
    <br>
    <p>Last thing I remember, I was</p>
    <p>Running for the door</p>
    <p>I had to find the passage back to the place I was before</p>
    <p>'Relax,' said the night man,</p>
    <p>'We are programmed to receive.</p>
    <p>You can check out any time you like,</p>
    <p>But you can never leave!'</p>
